## C

Today we’ll learn a new language, C: a programming language that has all the features of Scratch and more, but perhaps a little less friendly since it’s purely in text:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)
{
    printf("hello, world\n");
}
```

- Though the words are new, the ideas are exactly as same as the “when green flag clicked” and “say (hello, world)” blocks in Scratch:

![when green flag][when green flag]

[when green flag]: ../Images/Week1/when_green_flag.png "When Green Flag"

Though cryptic, don’t forget that 2/3 of CS50 students have never taken CS before, so don’t be daunted! And though at first, to borrow a phrase from MIT, trying to absorb all these new concepts may feel like drinking from a fire hose, be assured that by the end of the semester we’ll be empowered by and experienced at learning and applying these concepts.

We can compare a lot of the constructs in C, to blocks we’ve already seen and used in Scratch. The syntax is far less important than the principles, which we’ve already been introduced to.
